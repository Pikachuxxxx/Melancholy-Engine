### About
- A quick 3D editor/long-term game engine kinda app for iPad using Metal. An experimental engine to see if it is possible to actually make a standalone Game Engine for iPad and Mac ecosystem. 
- Probably add the ability to build and design games in iPad and port it to web and use apple native libraries for UI and iCloud 
- Add other engine capabilites using native/specific integrations using only Apple's technologies.
